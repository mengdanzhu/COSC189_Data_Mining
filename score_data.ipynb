Back then i wouldnt ever have imagined how much time this game would take from me. At some point i was playing 12+ hours a day for weeks. Now im approaching my 19th birthday and im kind of conflicted on what kind of impact  this game had on my life. I learned a lot about myself and generally speaking matured a lot regarding interacting with other humans. Dota isnt just a game, Dota is something else, something i have never experienced even when i was addicted to a mmorpg when i was 9-13. You learn how to learn, how to improve, how to win and how to lose. The most important thing dota teached me was how emotions impact your performance, and that  saying \"nothing\" is sometimes the best thing to do. In real life no one really teaches you stuff like that since people are kind of used to dealing with emotional ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. 2. Did i waste my youth?:So this sounds a bit depressing but this is a thought that i had sometimes. but realisticially speaking, knowing myself, im really unsure of how much my life wouldve been different if i never started dota. I asume i wouldve been a bit further regarding social contacts but career/school-wise i highly doubt  that it wouldve made a big difference. You gotta  be realistic when thinking about stuff like this. Im not a very social guy. I dont like to put work into stuff i dont care about. The thoughts \"lets learn music\"  or \"lets study\" wouldnt have EVER crossed my mind when i was 15. Im pretty sure if i wouldnt have started with dota i wouldve just been gooning around the city and abuse drugs, since thats a lot of fun to me. Back then i actually never even thought about working on something to improve, that whole dimension of \"improving\" wasnt even there for me. I just went to school got home and did fun stuff sometimes. Thats it. No goals. No aspiration, nothing. Dota changed that.3. time invested into dota2:EVERY dota player that has spent more than 1000 hours into this game has had that thought of \"oh man i shouldve learned something  with this time.... i couldve been amazing now..\" at some point. But everyone is disregarding the fact that grinding dota is something VERY EASY and comfortable to do, unlike studying or learning an instrument. Just think about what kind of game dota 2 is that spending 1000s of hours is something you do with pleasure. It\\'s kind of insane thinking about it. Once i started studying more for  school again i realized how much ♥♥♥♥ing time 100 hours is. I garantue you that you  will be a top student if youd put 20 hours a week into studying outside of school. But the big difference is that dota is just so much more fun and REWARDING.REWARDING: dota 2 is ♥♥♥♥IGN REWARDING. you learn a new hero -> BAMM MMR. you start  understanding how to farm -> M .  M . R YOUR RANK GOES ♥♥♥♥IGN UP. IT FEELS AMAZING. at school you get an A and you smile for about 10 minutes and then youre back to being miserable. theres no punishment for being mediocre. At least thats how i feel right now and im graduating this year(grades are OK(kinda good, not great)). ReasoN I WROTE THIS: im downloading dota right now because my laptop is REALLY ♥♥♥♥ed up adn deletes files something, so i needed something to do CONCLUSION: AMAZING GAME, EATS ALL YOUR TIME, YOU WILL HAVE FUN(if you are competetive) hope someone will ever read this lol hit me up if you wanna chat  \\nPosted: September 22, 2011\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tgood game\\t\\t\\t \\nPosted: May 26, 2017\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSkipped classes thanks to Dota.Learned to gamble thanks to Dota.Learned to swear in 12 different languages thanks to Dota.Became racist thanks to Dota.All in all, Ruin your life simulator. 10/10 would recommend if you are trying to kill yourself.

Within a few days, however, you\\'ll feel an urge to play it. You\\'re going to watch videos of pro people teaching you how to play, and you\\'re going to think that now you\\'re really good.You\\'re wrong.Over time, however, things will get better, and you\\'ll actually start winning. Then, you start losing again, but this time it\\'s not your fault; it\\'s your teams fault. Always remember that NOTHING is EVER your fault. Your dumbass anti-mage was complaining that you were stealing his farm, but it\\'s your farm dammit! Then pudge is getting butthurt about losing lane because he never had a flying courier, when the real reason he lost is because he didn\\'t give you unit control when you are clearly a better pudge! Meanwhile the enemy team is getting fed because your teamates never backed you up when you blitzkrieged in 1v5, and they even have the nerve to question your methods! Then you notice that your dumbass anti-mage is in the jungle farming because \"he couldn\\'t farm in lane.\" You know, however, that he is just a noob.Eventually the enemy is pushing your tier 3s, and the game is obviously over. This is the time when you give up and sit in base. Ignore the fact that your team has won the last two teamfights and you are starting to catch up, it\\'s better if you just quit now. While you\\'re waiting in base, make sure that the enemy team knows that you are not at fault in your loss. Make sure you type in all-chat \"team noob\" followed up by \"report anti-mage.\" If they ask why you want them to report him, ignore them, if your team has the bodacity to try and defend themseves, repeatedly say phrases such as \"lol ur so bad\" and \"ur just mad cuz you cant play.\" You could also take the alternative route and say things like \" \\nPosted: April 25, 2014\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbest way to learn russian.\\t\\t\\t \\nPosted: May 15, 2014\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWhen I started playing Dota 2, I didn\\'t know any Russian, now I\\'m Vladimir Putin.

I\\'ve been playing Dota 2 for around 10 years since it was DotA, the Warcraft III custom map and I\\'ll tell you right now there\\'s still a lot of room for personal improvement. This game boils down to far more than individual skill, tactics, and teamwork/cooperation. The author of \"Three Lane Highway\" (see pcgamer.com) has called Dota an \"isometric wizard-em up\" game, and I think it\\'s fitting. There are so many aspects to this game, so many factors that control the outcome that if you try and sit down and list them all it\\'ll take you a couple hours. And you\\'ll still miss some. I have played pretty much every single \"Multi-player Online Battle Arena\" on the market, and no matter how interesting they are or what different elements they try to bring to the gameplay, I always end up coming back to Dota. If you want to seriously challenge yourself, and you have the will and motivation to work towards a lofty goal that many are unable to reach, this is the game for you.\\t\\t\\t \\nPosted: January 14, 2014\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThis game sucks, you can\\'t even jump.\\t\\t\\t \\nPosted: March 27\\nI started playing this game back when it was a mod on warcraft 3, it was great then, the community was ayy ok, not so bad, a little toxic but not too toxic...as the years went by I moved out from my parents house and had less time to play the game I had become addicted to, the game I would spend my Friday and Saturday night doing whilst the normal kids were out getting drunk on there 18th birthday.As a few years went back I began to realised that the cause of anxiety and depression are cured by playing this game but is also well known for causing it, so if you\\'re depressed or feeling anxious, it\\'s a 50 50 toss up as to whether you\\'re going to get worse or not, do you like living life on the edge?The game evolves around being the highest rank possible, at the most average of ranks you will get called trash and be flamed for being the same rank as your team mates.What is the community like you say?Some would describe the community in terms like \\'cancerous\\' and that\\'s about the only word I\\'ve heard.Favourite heard phrases? - Spoiler contains harmful, be warned.\\'Kill yourself\\' \\'Hang yourself\\' etc, what more do you want?Other than that, I have been playing the game for over 10 years of my life and currently plan to continue, whilst I\\'m doing that, I\\'m intoxicating myself with alcohol and feeding it down mid, thanks for reading.Good luck out there, you\\'ll need it.\\t\\t\\t \\nPosted: February 8, 2018\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tI have over 4000 hours and I want to kill myself.

Players pick from a pool of over a hundred   heroes  carries, forming two teams of   five players  five feeders. Radiant heroes then battle their Dire counterparts   to control a gorgeous fantasy landscape, waging campaigns of cunning, stealth, and outright warfare  raging in an unknown language and teamfighting with one RAMPAGE victor.Irresistibly   colorful on the surface  addictive, Dota is a game   of infinite depth and complexity  which requires, no, infact takes an infinite amount of your life away. Every hero has an array of skills and abilities   that combine with the skills of their allies in unexpected ways, to ensure that no game is ever remotely alike  that allow players to screw with their allies and get their teams killed. This is one of the reasons that   the Dota phenomenon has continued to grow  Dota will have more rage quitting and all chat abuse than any other game. Originating as a fan-made Warcraft 3 modification, Dota was an instant underground hit. After coming to Valve, the original community developers have bridged the gap to a more inclusive   audience  Russia, so that the rest of the world can   experience the same core gameplay, but with the level of polish that only Valve can provide  learn from these ingenious people and become inspired to spread their knowledge with the rest of the world.Get a taste of the game that   has enthralled millions  will happily teach you fluent russian all for the sweet price of $0.

I was from HoN for like 2-3 years before Dota 2 was released and tried LoL and actually enjoyed it for a bit but then went back to HoN.Dota 2 is a great game, an awesome game. I really should have thought about spending money on a free game but to hell with it I say. Mechanics are well designed, what makes a hero OP is the player behind it and the team that surrounds it. This is a team game people, so team work is a must (unless you are solo queuing, then you have to carry your garbage of a team but it can be the other way around). Monster gamers are real.Dota 2 has taught me a lot of things, you can only be good at something if you focus on it, learn from mistakes, be aware of your surroundings, trust your instinct, use common sense, trusting on your team to always have your back, believing in your capabilities, always try to be better than you were yesterday, and that..THE COMEBACKS ARE REAL!!!This game bought me and my friends together for lan parties and strengthen our bonds. A mere game that brings people together, not just friends but complete strangers too. Dota 2 is a game that will never be forgotten.All in all, I recommend this game to everyone who wants to experience pain, suffering, and torment because at the end, you will come to a sudden realization that things are always bound to get better.P.S. Calm down, it\\'s just a game...\\t\\t\\t \\nPosted: February 4, 2014\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tI used to play LoL, and sunk  more money into that game than I care to admit.  The great thing about DotA, is EVERY hero is unlocked from the start.  LoL has a limited selection of free champions every week, which is fine, but your options are limited during drafting.  I found myself buying champs that were popular in the current meta just to compete.  I haven\\'t played LoL in months since getting into DotA, how can I?  This game is so much more complex (which is daunting at first), but the more you learn and play the better it gets.  Every day I learn something new, I try a new hero or two, and it\\'s awesome.Highly recommend checking out http://www.reddit.com/r/learndota2 as well as http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Dota_2_Wiki .http://www.devilesk.com/dota2/apps/interactivemap2/ is a great map.I may have spent more time watching gameplay vids/strats and tournaments than actually playing the game!

I wrote\" negative 25.\")Playing with friends: 11/10Competitiveness&balance: 11/10----------------------------------------INTRO--------------------------------------------------         For those of you who aren\\'t familiar with the MOBA genre, here\\'s a quick explanation. There are two bases, each on opposing corners of the map, and one for each team. The objective is to destroy the opposing team\\'s base. Three roads, or lanes, connect the bases. Low-level units automatically and periodically spawn from each base in groups, and these soldiers travel down the three paths between the bases. As a result, there is always a battle going on in the trio of lanes.In addition, each team has three defensive towers in each lane on their side of the map, totaling nine towers per team. These structures deliver powerful attacks against enemy soldiers and players, but they can be destroyed through significant effort. Because of this, fights tend to center on the towers.         All of this happens automatically. Unlike in typical RTS games, you don\\'t have to collect resources, build structures, or train units. You only control your hero, which can level up and acquire a range of upgradeable powers. However, its role might best be described as support for the A.I. soldier units. Players help control the battlefronts and destroy enemy towers in the lanes. The idea is to to open your opponent\\'s base up to a direct attack by the A.I. and hero once the towers in a lane are gone. There are five players per team, which of course doesn\\'t divide into the three lanes equally. When a player dies, he respawns at the team\\'s base after a penalty period.Overall:pros: A much better game than lolcons: A much harder game than lolLMAOquit playing trash game plz----------------------------------------Pro&Con---------------------------------------------PROS1,   All At Your Fingertips – players have access to ALL of the game\\'s heroes from the start. No need to unlock or purchase heroes. ( poor LOL)2,  Snowball Easily – dying results in a loss of gold, can magnify the effects of snowballing(Buyback system can make sure you don\\'t lose a game with just one mistake).3,  Huge Variety of Cosmetics and Skins – players can customize individual parts of their heroes from both valve and community. (weapons, armor, helmets, etc.).4,   Custom Game Support – players can build their own custom games within Dota 2 (Pudge Wars, Tower defenses, Racing, Battleships, and more!)5,   Skill-Based and Competitive – similar to LoL, Dota 2 is heavily reliant on a player\\'s skill, is very competitive, and has a large e-Sports scene.CONS:1 , Dota directly affects on your life (social life) 2 , Time consuming( Avg about 45 min per game + additional queuing time(about 3-10 mins depends on your region))3 , Hard for newbies ( up to 500 hrs bot practices at least ---usually about 800 hrs)4 , hbp due to rage (you may having 3 r e t a r d s and peru feeder/feeders on your side of team)5 , Addiction(the true e-drug)---------------------------------------ADDITIONS---------------------------------------------Don\\'t spend too much money on treasures. All the rare items can be purchased through community market if you feel like you are not gonna get any of rare sets.\\t\\t\\t \\nPosted: May 26, 2014\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t♥♥♥♥♥game but its alright 10/10 get it again\\t\\t\\t \\nPosted: June 20, 2014\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tRosetta Stone Simulator.

The most fantastic game that improves skillset used in everyday life! After a couple of hours I already got the hang of the game. It is a real rewarding piece with a beautiful community that is keen on helping you improve and unleash your hidden potential. Even though I\\'ve achieved the highest Badge possible in the game (which is also a great and original idea to somewhat categorize players), I am still reminded day-by-day that I\\'m pretty new to the game and I should focus on polishing my skills, which is a huge help since I am somewhat a maximalist.The Dev Team is amazing and fast to reply in cases of bugs, broken things throughout the game that would otherwise alter the potential outcome of important Ranked Matches. I would highly recommend it to people thinking about taking up a semester abroad or such since it does help You enourmously when it comes to foreign languages.After just 2 years I was fluent in Russian and Spanish even though I have never taken a class before and this allowed me to travel to St Petersburg and Barcelona taking my language skills to the next level. It\\'s easy to make friends, people have no prejudice when it comes to your Badge, Divine (highest rank in the system) players play with Heralds (lowest rank in the system) and enjoy spending some free time with their fellow bratushki. I would also like to thank Valve for the amazing support towards amateur and semi-professional teams, the sponsoring of various national tournaments all over the globe and the ability to connect with each other in real life through this amazing franchise.  Finally a piece about some skills I have acquired throughout the game:  Tenacity   - The game rewards You trying really hard to win games and works on pushing you even further. The higher your impact in games, the lower impact people it will match with you, resulting in you having to push even harder. Amazing! International Communication  - Understand people from all over the globe through simple words, hieroglyphs, and ancient text. Being able to acquire and share information in a new and intuitive way. Leadership  - Some people take the role of the good soldier and some that of the leader. With Power however comes Great Responsibility. You are ready to make calls and lead your team towards victory? Keep in mind that you will also be accounted for the consequences of a miscall. But in the end you will become more daring and even better at leading with example! Analytical Skills  - The more you play the more advanced you become and analysis, prediction and understanding of movement and thoughts of people you have never met before. Paired with your glorious Communication Skills you will be able to share and respond to any situation. You will effectively be able to see the future as it is! Focus  - While most games are circa 30 minutes long,  some games can take an eternity in some games you spend a wonderful 1,5 hrs time together with 9 other nice people who you learn to know during this experience. The longer the game lasts however, the harder it becomes since any small mistake you make can be the end of the struggle. You acquire the ability called Laser Focus: eyes on the goal, maximum efficiency, 0 error factor. High level players have iron nerves! Personal Growth  - As human beings we must understand that sometimes we win and sometimes we  get stomped cuz there is a premuted accbuyer in my team learn. After lost games we still are eager to learn from our mistakes, commend the people that accounted for the win on the opposing team and pat the weaker players on the back. Standing up after a failure is a key factor in creating something new, in evolving. DotA is a major enhancement in this area.Give it a try, enjoy your time and who knows we might meet in game! ;)Cheers, Daniel \"Zen\" Stirling   \\nPosted: June 13, 2014\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tImagine yourself trapped in a sewer swimming around eating nothing but turds your entire life, each turd represents an average public game. Now imagine after all of those turds you go to eat the another one and to your surpise it is a chocolate bar, it is the best feeling in the world.

You will lose. You will improve your skill, but you will never improve your score. --wait for it--No. Matter. What. Why? Because of THE TRENCH / ForcedFifty. -The better you get at this game, the worse your teammates will be. This is not a paradigm, it is mechanically programmed into the game. -If you can carry 1 idiot on your team, the game will handicap you with 2. Skilled enough to carry 2? After a few games you will get 3. Hardcore enough for 3? Now you get FOUR-ever. -Your teammates will -- i ♥♥♥♥ you not－－ go out of their way to lose on purpose. You picked another carry because it seemed logical? Well guess what, I got a few replays that will show crybabies throwing the game so you cant compete for thier spotlight. This is the only game where teammates ENJOY LOSING because it means they can bring you down to their garbage level. -People literally buy and sell accounts off MMR because of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ teammates and you will be a guinea pig in their money making ponzi schemes.

I highly reccomend that if you play dota 2 be as non-toxic,friendly and supportive as you can. I have 100% won games just because I would thank my support and tell them how good of a job they are doing  or telling my ganker  or tank all the good things they are doing but the secret to winning is to be so nice that you can influence the people in your game to make good decisions like actually putting wards down so we dont get ganked and have vision or not going into that 1v5 just because you have resurrection up and feeding god dammit wraith king. Alot of people always say Dota 2 is a good game but the community is trash and just simply dont realize that they are also a part of the community and as part of the community it will become your job as i\\'ve realized is mine to be just simply a nice person, And I understand that there are these super toxic people and trolls and thats going to happen it\\'s part of any game but that\\'s what the mute button is for and if everybody would actually just try to be a nicer player those extremely toxic players would have a hell of a time being toxic if everyone on their team was complementing them if they did something good and just giving them advice. Dota 2 can be a great game where you can make lots of friends and have a good time or it can be a game where you log in everyday you scream and rage at the 4 other people that are suppose to be your teammates and have a horrible time, In the end it is up to you which path you will take. In short just be a nice dude and your positivity will spread, -Why can\\'t everyone just be nice?\\t\\t\\t \\nPosted: March 24, 2014\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThis game cured my erectile dysfunction.xaxaxaxaxaxaxaxa\\t\\t\\t \\nPosted: September 8, 2014\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tI fail my exams, I almost lost communication with my family and friends..became lifeless and reached 2k+ hours on Dota 2 and still have no regrets. 11/10 would die playing for this game.

This game is a testament to how the vast majority human beings possess selfishness beyond limits and stupidity beyond measure. The community of this game is evidence that we truly live with a \"coddled generation\" of children who were raised to believe that they are special and unique and superior to all other people and can literally do no wrong.

I never wrote a review though. It\\'s timeto close this chapter and leave here a blueprint of my experience.It\\'s a good game looking at it at the aspect of graphics, mechanics or even design in general. The idea behind this game, honestly, is very good. Especially if you have 4 other friends to play it with would be fun. If you appreciate your time, it\\'s not a good choice though. Here\\'s why:1. No surrender. Matches can last up to 1 hour and a half, aproximately. There is a chance that you can\\'t win from minute 30 or 20. To popstone the game from minute 20, if your enemy wants to have fun or you don\\'t give up because you can\\'t accept that you are going to loose anyway OR having teamates that don\\'t give up it\\'s really a waste of time. As pointed out before you have NOT the option to surrender. If you stack with someone that didn\\'t like your move or something and he curses or flames you all game you have to wait until the game ends. If you leave, theres a punishment. You have an option to mute the players but if this someone wants to, he can sabotage you ingame.2. Rewarding with MMR.No one understands it and the developers doesn\\'t give clues. You don\\'t really know where to focus. Furthermore, winning in solo Ranked is just a matter of luck. Yes, if you are a DOTA 2 God you can win. But, if your role is out of the meta, i think it\\'s really a matter of luck.3. Products.There are things that you have to pay in order to use them. Like Roles MatchMaking or cosmetics or hero chat phrases. In my opinion, what the developers have to offer in compare with the price is, simple, not worth. MatchMaking Roles, for example, as far as i know, are in a lot of other MOBA games, if not all, a standar feature. Being, one of the largest games in the market, i think you owe to offer that feature. Furthermore, Battle Pass quality declines every year. It needs a lot of money to have access to cool features and have fun with them. Leveling something with money, having the cool things untouchable for the poor guys to reach them is kind of sad, in my opinion.4. The community.I was one of the good guys, for years. Not yelling or flaming in game. Being teachful and helpful. Didn\\'t answer to insults or flames. However, im not that guy anymore. The community changed me and today i saw it clear. I have read articles about ingame mechanics, the meta, builds and strategy. I trained hard. Well, somedays you can\\'t play well or you don\\'t have that wow game or the other is better than you in your lane! Noone will understand it. Flames, curses and insults are all over you. The funny thing is you are not going to understand it either after plenty of games, according to my experience.Before you start this game, consider the quality of your time!Thanks for your time.  \\nPosted: November 22, 2017\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBest game ever <3!\\t\\t\\t \\nPosted: February 9, 2016\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWhat once began as a new era for DotA, filled only with potential and passion for the game, started out with only hopes and dreams for the game and the community, with valve\\'s employees dedication and foresight they were able to develop patch after patch of high quality and entertainment value.

Instead, there now lies weekly hat updates, and a game update every couple of months of so If the developers are feeling it. Not only is the development side of valve lackluster, but, with the recent community aspirations for the annual \\'diretide\\' event, Valve has now not only ignored the celebratory season, but what is really saddening is their community management/responsiveness when it comes to such events in general.

This game is not for the faint hearted. You will be abused, beaten, broken, griefed, tormented and hated on the entire time, and yet you can\\'t stop playing because of the high you get when you win an 80 minute comeback game against  mega creeps and divine rapiers. This must be how drug addicts feel. But is it worth it? Dota 2 takes sane men and turns them into vile despicable human beings and you have to play with and against such people on a regular basis. To win you must now become captain of the SS dumbf**k and somehow try to convince your teammates fighting the enemy team and not their own is in their best interest.It\\'s also got he highest concentration of Dunning–Kruger patients in the entire online gamming community. Valve\\'s terrible low priority system doesn\\'t help.Assuming you\\'re a masochist and you aren\\'t deterred by all of the above, you get to experience probably the best free online multiplayer game on the planet. With dota 2 you get...... 115 heroes, 100+ items,hundreds of 5 hero strategies, tens of thousands of lane matchups and infinite replayability. You can and will spend years just learning about each of them. Dota 2 has a thriving pro scene with the international giving out the biggest prize pools in all of esports and many regular sports. New patches and compendiums keep the gameplay fresh for most of the year. The latest international had a 95.5% pick rate of heroes which is a testament to how well the game is balanced.And if you\\'re a gambling man, dota 2 is just the game for you. Introducing more lootboxes than any other game you\\'ve ever seen! Want literally any cosmetic in the game? Well there is a lootbox with your name on it waiting to be opened gabeN.Just remember no matter how good you get at dota, you\\'re never good enough....and you\\'ll end up chasing the mirage of a high mmr and good players while trodding though mud and $h1t  and you never realize it\\'s not real till you\\'re in too deep.\\t\\t\\t \\nPosted: April 25, 2017\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCauses anxiety problems, low self esteem, Tourette\\'s syndrome, mood swings, Bipolar disorder, breakdown of relationships, raging erections, racism.

To detail in depth just what makes it so excellent would take a dozen pages at least. Suffice to say that the game is comprised of a multitude of mechanics, each of which is like it\\'s own \"mini-game\" within the larger game. What makes Dota a masterpiece is that it is so much more than the sum of it\\'s parts. The way that the individual elements fit together to make a single whole is simply extraordinary and the result of decades of refinement. However, while the game itself is nothing short of a masterpiece, the experience of playing it with others is often deeply unpleasant. It is fairly common for competitive online games to have a larger than average portion of toxic players. However, nothing comes close to Dota, both in the quantity of toxic players and the degree to which they can negatively impact your experience playing the game. In Dota, one toxic player can easily doom an entire team. As a result of this power, toxic players can effectively hold teams hostage, forcing them to capitulate to their demands or face a 40+ minute miserable experience. Toxic players can be muted, but Dota requires all five players to cooperate, so muting someone generally results in a four man team, which severely diminshes one\\'s chance of winning.The scariest part of all of this is that the last time I checked, I had a near perfect behavior rating, which means that on average, I was matched with \"better behaved\" players. Furthermore, I have a fairly tough skin, and am used to online flaming. Nonetheless, I would estimate that at least 20% of my matches were ruined by toxic players: not because they played poorly, but because of their communications and behavior. I played Dota constantly for years and I never once lost my love for the game itself. But eventually, the behavior of the players made me give up. Winning a match was as much about managing the emotions of your teammates as they were about playing well.The reason that I am recommending Dota is that there is one easy way to avoid this toxicity: play with friends! When you have a team of people working together, there are few, if any games, that can match the experience. Everyone has an essential role to play, and everyone can find their unique niche. This is the way the game is intended to be played and I truly cannot overstate just how fun it is.The bottom line: Dota is a masterpiece that only shines when playing with a cooperative team. Solo play just isn\\'t viable long term for anyone but the most patient and devoted.\\t\\t\\t \\nPosted: August 24, 2018\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThis is coming from someone who loves dota and has put a pretty decent amount of time into it, but let me tell you it really wasnt worth it. This comminuty is without a doubt the absolute worst I have ever played with in a video game. I have played a LOT of games, but nothing comes even close to describing how horrible the players are. Every single game you play, your teamates will constantly bicker and fight with each other like children, and should you ever find yourself on the other end of this bickering, just prepare to quit now. Every single person on your team looks for one person to blame, and if that person gets blamed they will not ever hear the end of it for the horrible hour some matches can last. THe most fun I had in this game were when I was just playing with my friends and just having a good time. Only because I didnt have o play with random people. But most of the community is fedora wearing grease stained neckbeards that lose their♥♥♥♥♥♥so easily. I understand that it is a competetive game and all but it makes me angry when some new player just wants to play but even in casual games people are so toxic. If your team isnt toxic enough, the opposing team certainly will be. I have a feeling that the most typed thing in this games chat is EZ. The enemy team will constanly spam WP EZ at you every time you make a mistake.I know some prick will say, Duhh you are just complaing cuz ur bad, or just mute them duh, or every game is toxic dota is no different but let me tell you, if you think any of those things you are the type of person ruining my beloved game. That is what really huurts the most, that I love this game. I love the idea and the gameplay and really everything about it, but the community is so unbearable that i just feel disgusted after every game I play. Even if my team wins my teamates are just telling how awful the enemy team they are and honestly I am just sick of hearing those sorts of things. But if you have 4 other people to play with this game can be a whole lot of fun, and if chill people wanna play together then feel free to add me, but other then that im just sick of dealing with such a disgusting grease riddled community.\\t\\t\\t \\nPosted: December 9, 2013\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBEST GAME FOR MY ANGER MANAGEMENTWow is this game relaxing!

It is a real rewarding piece with a beautiful community that is keen on helping you improve and unleash your hidden potential. Even though I\\'ve achieved the highest Badge possible in the game (which is also a great and original idea to somewhat categorize players), I am still reminded day-by-day that I\\'m pretty new to the game and I should focus on polishing my skills, which is a huge help since I am somewhat a maximalist.The Dev Team is amazing and fast to reply in cases of bugs, broken things throughout the game that would otherwise alter the potential outcome of important Ranked Matches. I would highly recommend it to people thinking about taking up a semester abroad or such since it does help You enourmously when it comes to foreign languages.After just 2 years I was fluent in Russian and Spanish even though I have never taken a class before and this allowed me to travel to St Petersburg and Barcelona taking my language skills to the next level. It\\'s easy to make friends, people have no prejudice when it comes to your Badge, Divine (highest rank in the system) players play with Heralds (lowest rank in the system) and enjoy spending some free time with their fellow bratushki. I would also like to thank Valve for the amazing support towards amateur and semi-professional teams, the sponsoring of various national tournaments all over the globe and the ability to connect with each other in real life through this amazing franchise.  Finally a piece about some skills I have acquired throughout the game:  Tenacity   - The game rewards You trying really hard to win games and works on pushing you even further. The higher your impact in games, the lower impact people it will match with you, resulting in you having to push even harder. Amazing! International Communication  - Understand people from all over the globe through simple words, hieroglyphs, and ancient text. Being able to acquire and share information in a new and intuitive way. Leadership  - Some people take the role of the good soldier and some that of the leader. With Power however comes Great Responsibility. You are ready to make calls and lead your team towards victory? Keep in mind that you will also be accounted for the consequences of a miscall. But in the end you will become more daring and even better at leading with example! Analytical Skills  - The more you play the more advanced you become and analysis, prediction and understanding of movement and thoughts of people you have never met before. Paired with your glorious Communication Skills you will be able to share and respond to any situation. You will effectively be able to see the future as it is! Focus  - While most games are circa 30 minutes long,  some games can take an eternity in some games you spend a wonderful 1,5 hrs time together with 9 other nice people who you learn to know during this experience. The longer the game lasts however, the harder it becomes since any small mistake you make can be the end of the struggle. You acquire the ability called Laser Focus: eyes on the goal, maximum efficiency, 0 error factor. High level players have iron nerves! Personal Growth  - As human beings we must understand that sometimes we win and sometimes we  get stomped cuz there is a premuted accbuyer in my team learn. After lost games we still are eager to learn from our mistakes, commend the people that accounted for the win on the opposing team and pat the weaker players on the back. Standing up after a failure is a key factor in creating something new, in evolving. DotA is a major enhancement in this area.Give it a try, enjoy your time and who knows we might meet in game! ;)Cheers, Daniel \"Zen\" Stirling',\n",

       " \"I have around 1,500 hours on this game if you total in the hours on both my main account and alt, This is currently the main account I am using. I highly reccomend that if you play dota 2 be as non-toxic,friendly and supportive as you can. I have 100% won games just because I would thank my support and tell them how good of a job they are doing  or telling my ganker  or tank all the good things they are doing but the secret to winning is to be so nice that you can influence the people in your game to make good decisions like actually putting wards down so we dont get ganked and have vision or not going into that 1v5 just because you have resurrection up and feeding god dammit wraith king. Alot of people always say Dota 2 is a good game but the community is trash and just simply dont realize that they are also a part of the community and as part of the community it will become your job as i've realized is mine to be just simply a nice person, And I understand that there are these super toxic people and trolls and thats going to happen it's part of any game but that's what the mute button is for and if everybody would actually just try to be a nicer player those extremely toxic players would have a hell of a time being toxic if everyone on their team was complementing them if they did something good and just giving them advice. Dota 2 can be a great game where you can make lots of friends and have a good time or it can be a game where you log in everyday you scream and rage at the 4 other people that are suppose to be your teammates and have a horrible time, In the end it is up to you which path you will take. In short just be a nice dude and your positivity will spread, -Why can't everyone just be nice?\",\n",

       " \"After years of playing this game, i can say it doesn't worth your time. I never wrote a review though. It's timeto close this chapter and leave here a blueprint of my experience.It's a good game looking at it at the aspect of graphics, mechanics or even design in general. The idea behind this game, honestly, is very good. Especially if you have 4 other friends to play it with would be fun. If you appreciate your time, it's not a good choice though. Here's why:1. No surrender. Matches can last up to 1 hour and a half, aproximately. There is a chance that you can't win from minute 30 or 20. To popstone the game from minute 20, if your enemy wants to have fun or you don't give up because you can't accept that you are going to loose anyway OR having teamates that don't give up it's really a waste of time. As pointed out before you have NOT the option to surrender. If you stack with someone that didn't like your move or something and he curses or flames you all game you have to wait until the game ends. If you leave, theres a punishment. You have an option to mute the players but if this someone wants to, he can sabotage you ingame.2. Rewarding with MMR.No one understands it and the developers doesn't give clues. You don't really know where to focus. Furthermore, winning in solo Ranked is just a matter of luck. Yes, if you are a DOTA 2 God you can win. But, if your role is out of the meta, i think it's really a matter of luck.3. Products.There are things that you have to pay in order to use them. Like Roles MatchMaking or cosmetics or hero chat phrases. In my opinion, what the developers have to offer in compare with the price is, simple, not worth. MatchMaking Roles, for example, as far as i know, are in a lot of other MOBA games, if not all, a standar feature. Being, one of the largest games in the market, i think you owe to offer that feature. Furthermore, Battle Pass quality declines every year. It needs a lot of money to have access to cool features and have fun with them. Leveling something with money, having the cool things untouchable for the poor guys to reach them is kind of sad, in my opinion.4. The community.I was one of the good guys, for years. Not yelling or flaming in game. Being teachful and helpful. Didn't answer to insults or flames. However, im not that guy anymore. The community changed me and today i saw it clear. I have read articles about ingame mechanics, the meta, builds and strategy. I trained hard. Well, somedays you can't play well or you don't have that wow game or the other is better than you in your lane! Noone will understand it. Flames, curses and insults are all over you. The funny thing is you are not going to understand it either after plenty of games, according to my experience.Before you start this game, consider the quality of your time!Thanks for your time.\",\n",

Instead, there now lies weekly hat updates, and a game update every couple of months of so If the developers are feeling it. Not only is the development side of valve lackluster, but, with the recent community aspirations for the annual 'diretide' event, Valve has now not only ignored the celebratory season, but what is really saddening is their community management/responsiveness when it comes to such events in general.

       " 'Dota 2 is one of the greatest team strategy games ever made. To detail in depth just what makes it so excellent would take a dozen pages at least. Suffice to say that the game is comprised of a multitude of mechanics, each of which is like it\\'s own \"mini-game\" within the larger game. What makes Dota a masterpiece is that it is so much more than the sum of it\\'s parts. The way that the individual elements fit together to make a single whole is simply extraordinary and the result of decades of refinement. However, while the game itself is nothing short of a masterpiece, the experience of playing it with others is often deeply unpleasant. It is fairly common for competitive online games to have a larger than average portion of toxic players. However, nothing comes close to Dota, both in the quantity of toxic players and the degree to which they can negatively impact your experience playing the game. In Dota, one toxic player can easily doom an entire team. As a result of this power, toxic players can effectively hold teams hostage, forcing them to capitulate to their demands or face a 40+ minute miserable experience. Toxic players can be muted, but Dota requires all five players to cooperate, so muting someone generally results in a four man team, which severely diminshes one\\'s chance of winning.The scariest part of all of this is that the last time I checked, I had a near perfect behavior rating, which means that on average, I was matched with \"better behaved\" players. Furthermore, I have a fairly tough skin, and am used to online flaming. Nonetheless, I would estimate that at least 20% of my matches were ruined by toxic players: not because they played poorly, but because of their communications and behavior. I played Dota constantly for years and I never once lost my love for the game itself. But eventually, the behavior of the players made me give up. Winning a match was as much about managing the emotions of your teammates as they were about playing well.The reason that I am recommending Dota is that there is one easy way to avoid this toxicity: play with friends! When you have a team of people working together, there are few, if any games, that can match the experience. Everyone has an essential role to play, and everyone can find their unique niche. This is the way the game is intended to be played and I truly cannot overstate just how fun it is.The bottom line: Dota is a masterpiece that only shines when playing with a cooperative team. Solo play just isn\\'t viable long term for anyone but the most patient and devoted.',\n",
       " 'This is coming from someone who loves dota and has put a pretty decent amount of time into it, but let me tell you it really wasnt worth it. This comminuty is without a doubt the absolute worst I have ever played with in a video game. I have played a LOT of games, but nothing comes even close to describing how horrible the players are. Every single game you play, your teamates will constantly bicker and fight with each other like children, and should you ever find yourself on the other end of this bickering, just prepare to quit now. Every single person on your team looks for one person to blame, and if that person gets blamed they will not ever hear the end of it for the horrible hour some matches can last.

But most of the community is fedora wearing grease stained neckbeards that lose their♥♥♥♥♥♥so easily. I understand that it is a competetive game and all but it makes me angry when some new player just wants to play but even in casual games people are so toxic.

The enemy team will constanly spam WP EZ at you every time you make a mistake.I know some prick will say, Duhh you are just complaing cuz ur bad, or just mute them duh, or every game is toxic dota is no different but let me tell you, if you think any of those things you are the type of person ruining my beloved game. That is what really huurts the most, that I love this game. I love the idea and the gameplay and really everything about it, but the community is so unbearable that i just feel disgusted after every game I play. Even if my team wins my teamates are just telling how awful the enemy team they are and honestly I am just sick of hearing those sorts of things.
